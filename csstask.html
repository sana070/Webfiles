<p> A program is a group of logical, mathematical, systematical and managed functions grouped together to perform a specific task. Just like there are various programs in the marriage such as Shanti, Barat Prasthan, Lagan, vadhu pravesh, reception, dham etc.</p>

<p> Programming is important for speeding up the input and output processes in a machine. Programming is important to automate, collect, manage, calculate, analyze processing of data and information accurately.

Programming is important to create software and applications that help computer and mobile users in daily life. Due to all these reasons, it’s really important to learn how to use programming languages in our daily life.

Java, javascript, C#, C++, PHP, Python, Swift, SQL, Ruby etc. programming languages are the reasons behind the innovations in information technologies. If today we are seeing robots, artificial intelligence, machine learning, bitcoins, the blockchain, IOT (Internet of Things), Cloud Computing etc. new technology and products in IT industry, then it’s because of programming languages.
</p>

<p>
Developing a program involves a series of steps. The programmer defines a problem, plans a solution, codes the program, tests the program and, finally, documents the program. Usually, the programmer defines what he knows and the objective, selects a program to use, debugs the program in stages after completion to ensure no errors are introduced and then documents the design, development and testing of the program. With the ever-changing face of computer technology, programming is an exciting and always challenging environment that few programmers ever dream of leaving.

<p> 
The source code for a simple computer program written in the C programming language. When compiled and run, it will give the output "Hello, world!".
A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to create programs that implement specific algorithms.

Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers, although there are programmable machines that use a limited set of specific instructions, rather than the general programming languages of modern computers. Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age.[1] From the early 1800s, programs were used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.[2] However, their programs (such as a player piano's scrolls) could not produce different behavior in response to some input or condition.</p>

 <p> &gt;HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.</p>
 <p> &gt;Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.</p>
<p>  &gt;HTML is a markup language and makes use of various tags to format the content. These tags are enclosed within angle braces <tag name="">. Except few tags, most of the tags have their corresponding closing tags. For example,  has its closing tag  and  tag has its closing tag  tag etc.</tag></p>

  <p> &gt;Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.</p>
<p>  &gt;CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</p></div>

<p> &gt;JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.</p>
<p> &gt;JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. </p>
